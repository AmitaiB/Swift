# Swift

Learning Swift the hard way!

This repository contains a bunch of projects I've hacked, while trying to
learn the Swift programming language. The language itself is nice, although
I noticed a few problems:
* The toolchain is still under development
* Alot of confusion around Swift 1.0 and Swift 2.0

Most of the projects are actually online programming challanges.
